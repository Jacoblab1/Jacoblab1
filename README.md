## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Jacob, a Software Developer from Ottawa, Canada.


ðŸ”­ Right now I'm building [SkinSort](https://skinsort.com), a platform designed to make skincare easier.
  - SkinSort is built with **Ruby on Rails**, and currently recieves over _50,000_ organic users per month.
  - On the database side, SkinSort uses PostgreSQL. Worker jobs that use Sidekiq & Redis help offload asynchronous tasks.
  - It's UI is all TailwindCSS, with a bit of Alpine.js sprinkled in to make things interactive.
  - Production deployment is handled by Heroku, which has scaled well so far to _4,000,000_ requests/month.

ðŸ’» I'm open to work oportunities!
  - I'm passionate about building well-engineered & well-tested applications.
  - Experienced with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and plenty of other tools such as PostgreSQL, Redis, and TailwindCSS.
